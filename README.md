# Hello World extension

This is a Hello World extension for Launch. It can be used as a starting template for developing your own Launch extension.

For more information regarding Launch, please visit our [product website](http://www.adobe.com/enterprise/cloud-platform/launch.html).

For more information regarding Launch extension development, please visit our [developer documentation](https://developer.adobelaunch.com/extensions/). Note the [Scaffold tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/reactor-scaffold) and [Extension Sandbox](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/reactor-sandbox) will be helpful in developing your own Launch extension.

## Development

### Running the sandbox

```
npm -v
```

Once Node.js is installed, run the sandbox by executing the following command from the command line within your project's directory:

```
npx @adobe/reactor-sandbox
```
